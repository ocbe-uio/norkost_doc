## Data import

To import data, locate the **Upload** button.

Select the **Target directory**. This is going to be where your uploaded data will be. I suggest to upload them into a folder called **data**, but you can name it whatever you need.

## Data export

Once the analysis is finished, you can download the data from your result folder.
First go to where the results are saved. 

Select the data you want to save, then click the button on the top.

This opens a list of options. Select **Export**:

Now you can modify the name for the file, so that it downloads the file you need on your local computer.
